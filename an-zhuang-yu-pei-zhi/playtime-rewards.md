# Playtime Rewards

**You need to enable time-reward option in config to use this feature.** Time rewards are permission based. If you ever want to reset a player's progress, you can do so by editing their permissions in your permission plugin. The permissions can be found [here](https://github.com/Angeschossen/Lands/wiki/Permissions#numbered-permissions).

#### How does it work?

Players can get a reward, for example ONE chunk, every x seconds.

***

#### Configuration

```
time-reward:
  enabled_17: false
  # Time settings
  # After how many seconds
  # should the players
  # get rewarded with plus 1
  # chunk, land, own land
  # or member.
  # NOTE: Timeunit is seconds
  time:
    # /Lands claim
    chunks: 3060
    # Lands the player can be part of.
    lands: 43200
    # Max land members (How many players can the land have?)
    members: 21600
    # Lands the player can create.
    # /Lands create
    lands-own: 86400
```

#### Maximum Restrictions

**Set the maximum amount of chunks etc. a player can get through playtime rewards.**
