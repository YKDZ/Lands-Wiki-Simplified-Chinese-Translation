# 联邦

## 什么是联邦

联邦是城镇的集合。城镇所有者可以通过执行命令 `/nations create <名称>` 来建立一个联邦。对应城镇将会成为这个新联邦的首都。一旦联邦被建立，就可以邀请其他城镇加入。

## 为联邦成员开放权限

你可以通过在城镇菜单中修改名为“联邦”的职位的相关设置来管理与你同属一个联邦的所有城镇的成员在你的城镇中能进行的行为。

## Land and Nation Upkeep

Lands that are part of a nation will no longer pay upkeep to the server, but instead to the nation they're part of. The nation, however, can configure how much upkeep lands of their nation need to pay to them. Also, the nation needs to pay upkeep to the server. That means that setting an upkeep on their lands may be crucial to pay the upkeep costs for the nation to the server. The nation can configure the upkeep on the lands in their nation menu. The nation menu can be opened by executing `/nations`. If you're part of multiple lands, and you want to edit a nation to a different nation, execute `/lands edit <land>` to let the `/nations` command be executed for this specific land.

## Nations in Wars

Nations can declare war against other nations, like lands, by executing `/wars declare <land or nation>`. All lands in the nation will fight in this war. If a player is part two of lands that are not in the same nation, the player will join the team in which they are part of the most lands. In this case, lands they own will be prioritized. Depending on your server's configuration, a single land can also declare war against a whole nation.

## Nation Levels

A nation can level up by various factors which depend on your server's setup. Levels will reward you and your nation members with more claims and other benefits. You can view the level of your current nation by executing `/nations` and the clicking on the statistics item.
